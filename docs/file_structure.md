# Tiles file structure

The tiles are stored as `FF/images/{tick}/{zoom_later}/{x}_{y}.[png|jpg]`.
- The `{tick}` is always `0` since the timelapsing feature is not implemented.
- zoom layer, 8 is the most zoomed in. 1 is the least zoomed in.
  - 8 is written by the mod by directly taking screenshots.
  - 7 - 1 are generated by combining 4 adjacent tiles from the lower level.
- jpg is the default. You can request png by invoking `ff` with `--png`.
